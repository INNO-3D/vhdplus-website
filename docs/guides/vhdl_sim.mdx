## Written tutorial

### Setup

1. (Optional) Open `Extras > Package manager` and install the VHDL Language Support
2. (Optional) Open `Extras > Settings > Editor` and select what support you want to use

You can click on `File > Import Quartus Project` to import an existing VHDL project

### Create a VHDL project

1. Create a new project and select `VHDL Project with Simulation`. An example for a blinking LED will be created.
```vhdl
blink: process(clk)
begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
        if counter < 1000000 then
            counter <= counter + 1;
        else
            counter <= 0;
            LED     <= NOT LED;
        end if;
    end if;
end process blink;
```
2. A testbench file will be created where the clock signal is simulated. 
An instance of the blink code is created and simulated.

```vhdl
clk_proc: process
begin
    while finished /= '1' loop
        CLK <= '0';
        wait for period_time/2;
        CLK <= '1';
        wait for period_time/2;
    end loop;
    wait;
end process clk_proc;

u1: Demo
port map
(
    CLK => CLK,
    LED => LED
);
```
[Here](https://vhdlguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vhdl/testbench.html) you can find more information on creating testbenches for you VHDL code  

## Start the simulation

1. Do a right click on the testbench file and select `Simulate with GHDL` or `Simulate with Modelsim`
2. Check for errors in the output window

For GHDL:

3. After GTK Wave is open, click on the component of which you want to see the signal
4. Double click the signal to display in the wave window
5. You can zoom out and see the simulated behavior

For Modelsim:

3. After Modelsim is open, right click the signal to simulate and click on `Add to Wave`. Or you can just drag an drop the signals.
4. Select the `Run Length` and run the simulation with the buttons on top
5. You can zoom out and see the simulated behavior

## Done âœ” Need help?

If everything worked as planned, the LED of your FPGA should blink every second.<br/>
