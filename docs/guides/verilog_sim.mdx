## Written tutorial

### Setup

1. (Optional) Open `Extras > Package manager` and install the Verilog Language Support
2. (Optional) Open `Extras > Settings > Editor` and select what support you want to use

You can click on `File > Import Quartus Project` to import an existing Verilog project

### Create a Verilog project

1. Create a new project and select `Verilog Project with Simulation`. An example for a blinking LED will be created.
```verilog
reg [23:0] counter = 0;

always @ (posedge clk) 
begin
    counter <= counter + 1'b1;
end

assign led = counter[19];
```
2. A testbench file will be created where the clock signal is simulated. 
An instance of the blink code is created and simulated.

```verilog
Blink UUT (.clk(clk), .led(led));
    
    initial
        begin
            forever
                #41.666 clk = !clk;
        end
```
[Here](https://verilogguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/verilog/testbench.html) you can find more information on creating testbenches for you Verilog code  

## Start the simulation

1. Do a right click on the testbench file and select `Simulate with Modelsim`
2. Check for errors in the output window
3. After Modelsim is open, right click the signal to simulate and click on `Add to Wave`. Or you can just drag an drop the signals.
4. Select the `Run Length` and run the simulation with the buttons on top
5. You can zoom out and see the simulated behavior

## Done âœ” Need help?

If everything worked as planned, the LED of your FPGA should blink every second.<br/>
