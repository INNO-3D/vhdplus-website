### GTKWave is no longer required!

We want VHDPlus IDE to have all tools nessesary for FPGA Programming.
Since GTKWave was not reliable on some platforms, we create to build our own VCD viewer.

The VCDViewer in it's current state works with great performance.
Still, there are some features missing that will we added in the next updates. 
**If you prefer GTKWave**, it is still possible to use it by setting the option `Use GTKWave` located in `Extras -> Settings -> Simulator`
