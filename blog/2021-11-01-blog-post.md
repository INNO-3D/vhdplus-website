<!--truncate-->

### Reasons to use the MacOS version
As you might know, there is no official Quartus for MacOS, so sadly it is not possible to use this version to program our hardware directly.
Still, we wanted to publish a version for MacOS, so you can still use your Apple computer to work on your projects.

You can expect the following features:
- Full VHDP and VHDL support
- Simulation with GHDL
- All of our IDE features that are not dependent on Quartus

#### We will support both x64 and arm64 architecture, so you can expect a smooth experience on your new MacOS hardware.
