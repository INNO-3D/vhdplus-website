### Huge VHDP Improvements!

In the last couple of months we spent a lot of time reworking our VHDP Language Service.
With VHDPlus IDE 0.10.6 we use a completely new Analyzer to help you writing your designs.

VHDP Support Changes:
- Greatly improved performance
- Smarter error check
- Type Checking
- Function Insight
- Better completion (especially for record types)

Additional Changelog:
- Improved overall performance
- Solution wide search (CTRL + Shift + F) now opens in a separate window (unless already docked)
- Lots of small bug fixes

Still, there is lots of room for improvement. If you find any bugs or want to suggest a change, feel free to do tell us on our [Discord](https://vhdplus.com/discord) or create an issue in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HendrikMennen/VHDPlus.Analyzer)
