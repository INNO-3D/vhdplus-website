#### Programming Software for your FPGA was never as convenient as today!

<!--truncate-->

With update 0.9.9.8 you can now conveniently debug your C++ Software inside VHDPlus IDE.
Simply set a breakpoint like you would with any other first class C++ IDE, click on the debug icon and wait until the program reaches the selected line of code. The tools allow you to view variables live while you run your program.

**Even though not all planned debugger features are implemented, it is already very useful.**

A detailed [beginner guide](/docs/guides/nios2#debugging) on how to use the NIOS II Debugger aswell as an video tutorial will be uploaded soon!

### Additional Changelog

- Added global-search to search for variables inside all open projects
- Added a new, convenient way of changing your active FPGA in case you connected multiple to your Computer
- Lot's of bugfixes & performance improvements
